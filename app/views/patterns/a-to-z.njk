    <p>The A to Z is made up of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the A to Z navigation which sits at the top of the page</li>
      <li>an A to Z list panel which houses all the links to pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="when-to-use-this-pattern">When to use this pattern</h2>
    <p>A to Z lists help users find the page they want by bringing together links to lots of pages about 1 broad subjectâ€‹. But they only work when users know the name of the thing they're looking for and they expect to find it under that subject.</p>
    <p>We've found that some users would rather go to an A to Z list of pages than search. For example, when they weren't sure how to spell a word like "appendicitis", they expected to find it in the A to Z.</p>
    <p>We currently use the A to Z pattern in these areas of the NHS website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">the Health A to Z</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">the Medicines A to Z</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="when-not-to-use-this-pattern">When not to use this pattern</h2>
    <p>Do not use the A to Z pattern:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to group pages on different broad subjects</li>
      <li>in a transactional service</li>
      <li>as part of a content page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="elements-of-the-a-to-z-pattern">Elements of the A to Z pattern</h2>

    <h3>A to Z navigation</h3>

    {{ designExample({
      type: 'a-z-nav'
    }) }}

    <p>Use the A to Z navigation at the top of the page.</p>

    <h3>A to Z list panel</h3>
    {{ designExample({
      type: 'a-z-list-panel'
    }) }}

    <p>Use the A to Z list panel below the A to Z navigation to help users to navigate around a large section, for example a range of different health conditions. The example on this page is from the Health A to Z page on the NHS website.</p>
    <p>The "Back to top" links let users jump back up to the A to Z navigation.</p>

    <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
    <p>During a research lab on the Health A to Z on the NHS website in 2018, all users were able to use the A to Z list and it behaved as they expected.</p>
    <p>However, some users missed the quick anchor links at the top of the page and instead scrolled through the items. These users found the list overwhelming.</p>
    <p>Some users did not use the "Back to top" links. Instead they preferred to scroll to the top of the page.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>We write "A to Z" not "A-Z" because this is generally clearer for people who use screen readers. Some screen readers ignore the dash and read "A-Z" as "Ay zed".</p>
