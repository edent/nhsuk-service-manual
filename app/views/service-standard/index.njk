    <h2 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">A. Meeting users' needs</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">1. Understand users and their needs in the context of health and care</h3>
    <p>Take time to understand your users' clinical, practical and emotional needs - and abilities - and the problem you're trying to solve for them.</p>
    <p>Think about people's entire experience and the systems and processes around the product or service you're building.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">2. Join things up and work towards solving a whole problem</h3>
    <p>Collaborate across team, programme and organisational boundaries and create a service that meets users' needs across all channels.</p>
    <p>Consider where your service fits in your users' healthcare journey and whether you can solve a whole problem or influence a wider solution.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">4. Make sure everyone can use the service</h3>
    <p>Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your service, whether it's for the public or staff.</p>
    <p>And people who don't have access to the internet or lack the skills or confidence to use it.</p>
    <p><a href="/service-manual/service-standard/4-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service">Read more about point 4.</a></p>

    <h3 id="point5"class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">5. Support a culture of care</h3>
    <p>Caring is the core business of the NHS. NHS services should provide a positive experience of care or help NHS staff provide a caring service.</p>
    <p>All services should make patients, the public and staff feel valued and supported and, as far as possible, involve people in their own care.</p>
    <p><a href="/service-manual/service-standard/5-support-a-culture-of-care">Read more about point 5.</a></p>

    <h3 id="point6" class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">6. Make your service clinically safe</h3>
    <p>Digital information, tools and services have the potential to cause patient harm.</p>

    <p>Make as many decisions as possible in the team so that you can respond quickly to what you learn about users and their needs.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">11. Define what success looks like and be open about how your service is performing</h3>
    <p>Work out how your service helps improve health and well being, people's experience of health and care, and the efficiency of the health service and how you will know that you're succeeding. If you can't measure health benefits, choose other suitable indicators.</p>
    <p>Collect performance information so that you can measure and show that the service is effective and improving.</p>

    <p><a href="/service-manual/service-standard/14-make-new-source-code-open">Read more about point 14.</a></p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">15. Use and contribute to common components and patterns</h3>
    <p>Use tried and tested components and patterns from <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/patterns/">the NHS digital service manual</a> or, failing that, <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">the GOV.UK design system</a>. If you develop your own patterns or components, share them publicly so other people can use them.</p>
