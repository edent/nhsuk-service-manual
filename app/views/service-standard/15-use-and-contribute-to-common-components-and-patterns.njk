    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Using common components and patterns means you don’t have to solve problems that have already been solved. By using a component or pattern that’s already been extensively tested, you can provide users with a good experience in a cost effective way.</p>
    <p>If you develop your own components or patterns, it’s important to share them so that others can benefit from your work.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>build on common NHS styles, patterns and components</li>
      <li>share details of any new components or patterns you create or adapt (for example, by contributing to the service manual)</li>
    </ul>
