  <h2 id="when-to-use-date-input">When to use date input</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/">GOV.UK design system</a> suggests using date input when you’re asking users for a date they already know.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use-date-input">When not to use date input</h2>
  <p>Do not use date input if users are unlikely to know the exact date you’re asking about.</p>
  <p>Read more on the GOV.UK design system about how to <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/">ask users for dates</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-date-input">How to use date input</h2>
  <p>Date input consists of 3 fields to let users enter a day, month and year.</p>
  <p class="rich-text">Group the 3 date fields together in a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> that describes them. You can see an example at the top of this page. The legend is usually a question, like "What is your date of birth?".</p>
  <p class="rich-text">If you are asking just <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page">1 question per page</a> as the GOV.UK design system recommends, you can set the contents of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that screen reader users will only hear the contents once.</p>

  <h2 id="error-messages">Error messages</h2>
  <p>Style error messages like this:</p>
  {{ designExample({
    type: 'date-input-errors'
  }) }}

  <p>Follow the guidance on <a href="/service-manual/components/error-message">error messages</a> and give specific error messages for specific error states.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>We tested date input as part of a "Register for a GP" journey in 2 labs. All users understood what they needed to do and were able to successfully complete the set task.</p>
  <p>If you’ve used this component, <a href="/service-manual/community">get in touch</a> to share your user research findings.</p>
  <p>Our date input is based on the one in the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/">GOV.UK design system</a>. GOV.UK say that they need to do more research to understand if users struggle to enter months as numbers and whether it's more helpful to let them enter months as text.</p>
