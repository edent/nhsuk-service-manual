  <h2 id="when-to-use-action-links">When to use action links</h2>
  <p>Use action links to signpost the start of a digital service.</p>

  <h2>When not to use action links</h2>
  <p>Do not use action links in forms. Use a <a href="/service-manual/components/buttons">button</a> instead.</p>
  <p>We don't use action links just to link to another page or site. If you need a link to stand out, you can use <a href="/service-manual/components/inset-text">inset text</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-action-links">How to use action links</h2>
  <p>Keep the words on the action link short. Start with a verb.</p>
  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>"Book an appointment" or "Apply for an EHIC card"</p>
  </div>
  <p>Action links usually sit in a block of text. You can also put one in a <a href="/service-manual/components/care-cards">care card</a>.</p>
  <p>You can have more than one action link on a page but avoid putting them near each other.</p>
