    <p>You need to understand your users and the service you're designing before you start writing the questions.</p>

    <h2>Things you need to understand</h2>
    <p>Make sure that your team understands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your users' needs and their accessibility challenges</li>
      <li>the relative size of different user groups and how your decisions will affect them</li>
      <li>the purpose and context of the form</li>
      <li>how your service collects information now</li>
      <li>the wider user journey and the service (and processes) around the form</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your team should also have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/7-test-your-questions">tested any existing forms</a> - watch users fill them in and watch staff deal with the answers</li>
      <li>talked about technology options - at least some initial discussions</li>
      <li>decided how you'll measure success</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If it's not possible to do a proper discovery</h2>
    <p>Good questions start with a good discovery. It's difficult to get them right without it. But if you can't do a discovery before you start, you can still improve your form.
    <p>Get members of the team to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>fill in the form as a user, as honestly as they can</li>
      <li>talk about the issues they found</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This exercise may help you identify areas to prioritise.</p>
    <p>Do your user research and <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/7-test-your-questions">test your assumptions</a>.</p>
