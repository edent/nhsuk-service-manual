    <h2>What is a form?</h2>
    <p>A form is a page that asks users for information in order to give them a service. It could be a web page or a paper page.</p>

    <h2>Form design and this guidance</h2>
    <p>Good form design consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>interaction design - making the form easy to use</li>
      <li>content design - making it easy to understand and answer</li>
      <li>service design - making it easy for the user to get things done</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This guidance focuses on writing good questions - making them easy to understand and answer - and getting the right answers. It will help you design better digital forms and, if your service still needs them, paper forms. It may also be useful if you're working on questionnaires or surveys.</p>
    <p>Use our tested <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">styles, components and patterns</a> to build forms that are easy to use (interaction design).</p>
    <p>Find out more about service design in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/introduction-designing-government-services">GOV.UK guidance on "Designing good government services: an introduction"</a>.</p>
