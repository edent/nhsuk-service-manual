  <h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>
  <h3>Numerals (1, 2, 3 and so on)</h3>
  <p>We use numerals for all numbers (including 1 to 2). People find numerals easier to read and they scan for them.</p>
  <p>For numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>1,000</p>
  </div>

  <p>For numbers less than 1, use 0 before the decimal point.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>0.25</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Examples of where we use numerals</h4>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey.</li>
      <li>It takes 1 to 3 weeks from the time you were exposed to chickenpox for the spots to start appearing.</li>
      <li>Do this for 1 or 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Depression affects about 1 in 10 people at some point during their life.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h5>At the start of a sentence</h5>
  <p>It is OK to use numbers at the start of a sentence but, if it looks confusing, consider rewording your sentence.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>14 units is equivalent to 6 pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine.</p>
  </div>

  <h5>In headings</h5>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>8 tips for healthy eating</li>
      <li>6-in-1 vaccine</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h5>In lists</h5>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>A portion is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>80g of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables</li>
      <li>30g of dried fruit</li>
      <li>150ml glass of fruit juice or smoothie</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h4>Examples of where we do not use numerals</h4>
  <p>We do not use numerals in some medicines information about <a href="#dosage">dosage</a> because we've found they can be confusing.</p>

  <h3>Ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on)</h3>
  <p>We use numerals with letter suffixes for ordinal numbers.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>"1st", as in "your 1st visit"</p>
  </div>

  <p>Do not use superscript. It does not always read out correctly on screen readers and could confuse people. </p>

  <h2 id="measurements">Measurements</h2>
  <h3 id="dosage">Dosage</h3>
  <p>We do not use a space between amount and measurement.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>The usual dose is 250mg to 500mg.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Use your judgement when explaining medicines doses. Avoid having 2 sets of numerals next to each other.</p>

    {{ table({
    panel: false,
    firstCellIsHeader: false,
    head: [

      {
        text: "We say:"
      },
      {
        text: "We do not say:"
      }
    ],
    rows: [
      [
      {
          text: "The usual dose is one or two 200mg tablets 3 times a day."
        },
        {
          text: "The usual dose is 1 or 2 200mg tablets 3 times a day."
        }
      ]
    ]
  }) }}

  <h3>Temperature</h3>
  <p>We use Celsius for temperature.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>a temperature of 38C or higher.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Read more about <a href="/service-manual/content/a-to-z-of-NHS-health-writing#temperature">temperature in the A to Z of NHS health writing</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="metric-and-imperial">Metric and imperial</h3>
  <p>We generally use metric. If it's helpful, add imperial in brackets, for example, for advice on cutting back on alcohol.</p>
  <p>Do not use imperial for medicines dosage or infant feeding.</p>

  <h2 id="dates">Dates</h2>
  <p>We use this format: 6 August 2018.</p>
  <p>As far as possible, spell out months in full. Screen readers read out shortened months (Jan, Feb and so on) in inconsistent and sometimes confusing ways.</p>

  <h2 id="time">Time</h2>

  {{ table({
    panel: false,
    caption: "TBD",
    firstCellIsHeader: false,
    head: [
      {
        text: "We use:"
      },
      {
        text: "We do not use:"
      }
    ],
    rows: [
      [
        {
          text: "5.30pm"
        },
        {
          text: "1730hrs"
        }
      ],
      [
        {
          text: "midnight"
        },
        {
          text: "	00:00, 12am"
        }
      ],
      [
        {
          text: "midday"
        },
        {
          text: "12 noon, 12pm"
        }
      ],
      [
        {
          text: "6 hours 30 minutes"
        },
        {
          text: "6.5hrs"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }) }}

  <h2 id="ranges">Ranges of numbers, dates and time</h2>
  <p>We use "to" for time, date and numerical ranges, not hyphens or dashes.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The surgery is open Monday to Friday, 2pm to 6pm.</li>
      <li>A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 means you're a healthy weight.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 id="fractions-and-percentages">Fractions and percentages</h2>
  <p>Spell out common fractions like two-thirds.</p>
  <p>For percentages, use the &#37; symbol - for example, 50&#37;. However, it's often better not to use a percentage. Instead of 50&#37;. </p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>You could say "1 in 2" or "half"</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
  <p>Use statistics sparingly. Consider the style of writing and your target audience. For example, readers of <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/">Behind the Headlines</a>, the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">Health A to Z</a> and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/">Live Well</a> on the NHS website will have different needs.</p>
  <p>Use the clearest, most meaningful format to explain what you're illustrating.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>Use "1 in 7 people" rather than "14.3% of people"</p>
  </div>

  <p>Avoid mixing different number formats. Use one or the other.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>Overall, around 7 in every 10 people live at least a year after diagnosis and around 5 in 10 people live at least 10 years</p>
  </div>
