  <h2 id="accurate">Accurate</h2>
  <p>Qualified clinicians check our clinical information and check that it is accurate, clinically safe and has been developed using relevant evidence-based guidance.</p>
  <p>Our content is factual, neutral and unambiguous. We do not use metaphors - we say what we mean.</p>
  <p>We avoid making subjective statements. Use words like "good", "bad", or "easy" with care.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>Don't talk about "a good chance of recovery"</p>
  </div>

  <p>We do use "good" and "bad" where our users do to describe their symptoms.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>"bad pain" or "bad breath"</p>
  </div>

  <p>We also use them when there's a good evidence base.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>We talk about "a good source of iron" or "lack of sleep is bad for your health"</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="clear">Clear</h2>
  <p>We use language that our users understand. We use plain English and do research to find out which words work best for them.</p>
  <p>We aim for a reading age of 9 to 11 years old. But we recognise that, with some medical information, it's not easy to achieve this. In this case, try to make sure that an 11 to 14-year old will understand.</p>
  <p>We avoid medical jargon and technical terms. We do use medical terms to help with understanding and search, but explain them when they're not commonly known.</p>
  <p>We use a plain English term first, then the medical term. Example: piles (haemorrhoids).</p>
  <p>We use the same style for specialist audiences like health professionals.</p>

  <div class="app-example">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Insight</strong>
    <p>Research has shown that <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/17/guest-post-clarity-is-king-the-evidence-that-reveals-the-desperate-need-to-re-think-the-way-we-write\" title="External website">most people prefer to read plain English</a>, and that the more specialist a person's knowledge is, the greater their preference.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Read <a href="/service-manual/content/health-literacy">our guidance on health literacy</a> to see why it's important to create content that's simple to read.</p>

  <h2 id="concise">Concise</h2>
  <p>We keep content to the point.</p>
  <p>We use short words. For example, we prefer "have" or "get" to "experience" in phrases like "if you experience headaches".</p>
  <p>We use short sentences - up to 20 words. We use short paragraphs - up to 3 sentences.</p>
  <p>We use subheadings and bulleted lists to help users find what they need.</p>
  <p>We use the active voice - "find a pharmacy" rather than "a pharmacy can be found".</p>
